It's so disappointing. ,"All alumni I spoke to prior to starting gave a similar 50/50 review - the teaching is amazing, the opportunity is great, but the cost may be prohibitively expensive for what you get out of it.

But in its current state, I would tell people to hold back from applying until the college has worked out its very serious issues.

The whole RCA reputation is a scam, perpetuated by us for not calling them out publicly. One of the few supposed workshops last term consisted of a guy that did not seem knowledgeable at all, even though they told us he's a sound expert (not saying he isn't, but he's definitely not a prepared teacher), consisted of him telling us to play around with the Premiere settings FOR FIVE HOURS and when asked some questions didn't even seem like he had used Premiere before. It felt it was an insult to us and our intelligence, like the school getting away with treating us like we're dumb and wouldn't notice the workshop was complete bullshit.

Rather than attempting to continue 'business as normal', transferring the teaching online yet keeping the structure the same, I believe the school should seek to find the best way of structuring teaching / the rest of the year to offer the students a learning experience as close to what they expected as possible. I think it is important to keep teaching going over this period, for students and staffs well being, however it would be far better to stretch the year and its deadlines over summer - to allow for the difficulties in working remotely, as well as the additional pressures and stresses that come with a global pandemic.

",Yes,No,No,Yes,No,"I think it is inadequate to only offer exceptional study routes that were already offered - available for personal issues such as illness.

The RCA has poorly supported students in this time of intense stress, along with the myriad of issues raised by the UCU strikes this year and the endless email chains across the college complaining about the college's facilities and lack of resources as it continues to grow. There is a lot to be disappointed in by the college's actions of the past few months.",Yes,Yes,,,,,,,"With many students expressing some form of solidarity with the UCU strikes, can we expect
the same in return from staff in this situation? Is there scope to think of the boycott of the virtual show as a shared strike action between students and staff?

Whilst the UCU Strikes and this Covid-19 crisis are not directly related, the response of RCA
management to both of these issues have proved that they are a poorly equipped management team failing to understand the pastoral purpose of higher education, and in particular the role of a degree show in arts education.

Whilst a boycott and a rebel show run by students would definitely a last resort, this would present an opportunity for staff and students to come together and make a strong statement against the increasing bureaucracy and financialisation of arts education.",

This can mean radical changes to our initial work intentions and general direction of the projects. 
Moreover, I don't think we are all equipped with the skills necessary to a solely digital presentation of our work that is actually successful and of a high standard across departments and that does the work enough justice. I am however aware that for some, especially those already used to working in this format, this might be more advantegeous. It might mean more public exposure and maybe more success for some.

I am supporting students who believe they need a physical show (as an architecture student, much of my work can be shown virtually) and understand why that is hard, and would support a later physical show for these students. But the college still needs to be financially able to run in future years (which is where there are issues on everyone deferring) and whilst everyone is in quarantine globally, life is still moving forward. This is a time where as students of the royal college of art, we should be inspiring the world globally with how we handle the situation - and I think campaigning to stop the virtual show like other schools have done is just following the crowd. We should instead work together to make the BEST out of a horrible situation, and this is an opinion that is very difficult to share when so many of the students are anti any sort of change it seems. ",Whilst I think students should be involved in these decisions somehow (eg. through surveys) obviously students will always want access to the building - but this isn't necessarily going to be possible for the remainder of our school year - so it will be extremely difficult to work together on that solution. ,,"Unfortunately I won't be able to come back at a later date to be involved in a physical show, as I will be moving to the US after graduating ",,,"I think the students need to see this as an opportunity - where possible - to rethink how we work, and make the most of a bad situation.

Presumably staff won't get additional reimbursement for the practical difficulties and stress of providing ""lost"" teaching on top of scheduled teaching commitments.

Whilst this did provide clarity that the research student body needed (hence why I answered the question about ""adequate"" communication with YES), the guidance was itself confusing and required a follow up email at 10pm from one of the SoAH Leads. 

One of the major issues with the delivery of this guidance though was that it came after one of the SoAH Leads sent an initial message several days ago saying further College level guidance would be coming ""shortly"". There was no suggestion about when we would receive the guidance and it left research students anxious, knowing that change to our exam format was potentially coming, but not receiving that guidance for days.

This allows international students who cannot stay for a postponed show to participate, and reflects a commitment by the College to provide some sort of alternative. Virtual shows are not easy to do well, and of course or will depend on the sophistication of the end product, but I cannot get my head around students' insistence for a physical show when there is no end date for quarantine in the UK, and bookings for the show space almost certainly won't be available when it does come to an end. The phrasing of the questions above and below is so leading and suggests that anyone who disagrees with these demands is not in solidarity with the students making them: these are unprecedented times, and of course we are in solidarity with students who will be missing out on the lack of a physical show. But it is important to recognise that it is currently impossible to plan for an alternative, given governmental guidance, and a virtual show could be treated as a springboard to point viewers to students' work that can then be showcased in a physical space at a later date.

The size of the studios have not expanded to meet our needs, so we do not have space to make large scale works, to really spread out to allow creative freedom. There is too much pressure on resources, like the kilns, there are simply not enough. The glass department doesn't even have a glass blower 5 days a week, and some technician staff who are highly skilled are tied up doing menial jobs whilst students have to work on other things. ",Yes,,,"I am happy with the level of updates from all staff and the RCA so far. I have never felt out of the loop, and I think the RCA has passed on information to us all at an appropriate speed. I think this is a very challenging time for everyone, and changing policies and making decisions for so many students is incredibly complex and therefore should not be made quickly. I think everything needs to be discussed properly with the appropriate people and decisions are being given to us in a considered way. ","For my first year I can complete my dissertation from home, with limited books and no physical visits to places. I think my dissertation will be somewhat limited, but hopefully good enough. For my second year, I would expect full access to the studios, technical staffing, facilities and library. That is what I am studying at the RCA for.

I will support them, as I hope they would do the same for us if we were in the same position. For some people, a virtual degree show might be a good compromise, and I would not want to take that away from them. However, for the vast majority, I believe waiting and doing a real degree show in the future would be a more valuable experience, even if this costs the RCA money to provide a suitable external space.

I think people should be able to stop now and then return but that someone like me cannot afford to carry on past the end date and so I need them to complete the studies by that time.

I would want the option to access facilities and workshops when I have time to develop my work after graduation. ,"Financial, Leaving London / UK, Work commitments, Family commitments, Personal reasons",Yes,My feeling is that those who need to should be able to do the virtual show. Those that have the resources to wait should be offered a show in September if the pandemic subsides. If it does not they should join the next years cohort and be given this term again.  ,,I think this is a very complicated issue and if things change time wise it will effect a lot of people in a way that is not possible. It is also imperative that people show their work in a way suited to their needs. There needs to be options. But also I think a shame to break up the group. I would prefer a virtual show for the graduation purposes and as a challenge to see what we can develop. But we should be offered a physical show whenever the pandemic shuts down as well. We should also be given free use of workshops and facilities next year for a term after graduation and also a reduction in fees to respond to the lack of studio space and proper teaching.,Yes,No,No,The programme and the teaching,No,,Yes,No,"I have elaborated in a few spaces about what I think. There needs to be a virtual show while we cannot congregate if people are to graduate. I am not able to not graduate on time. Or at least I am not able to not finish on time. Graduation may not matter but may to people going on with education and needing particulars. I am not sure.  I think they should offer a physical show as well later. The idea that everyone should boycott the show so that those who can afford to wait get to while other people cannot graduate seems wrong to me. There needs to be options and mutual support for the various needs of everyone. If the only option is home and virtual then the RCA needs to put funds and develop quickly strategies for this to be done effectively with : resources; couriers for work; more personal time with tutors etc; remote access to computers at the school; purchase of  specialist equipment for particular students;  licences for necessary software that is being use. 

Thanks for your work. Look forward to hearing more.",,,,,,,

With transport and national borders being affected, and living situations compromised, people need to adjust in radical ways. Furthermore, not everyone has the luxury of having space, materials, facilities or means to continue working from home (whether via online teaching or practice based research), even if the individual is actually capable of working beyond the effects of the pandemic. It is entirely unreasonable for the RCA to expect students to 'continue as normal' in the aim to graduate under the original time frame. ",Yes,No,No,Yes,No,"These 'routes to continue study' neatly package an in-fact very restricted option base which do not cater for the majority of the student body. Being offered the chance to continue your degree, achieve an equivalent certificate, or discontinue study altogether does not satisfy my need, want and expectation of exemplary education that we all, as paying students, are due. Too much time and educational attainment has been lost since February, and I am not willing to sacrifice any more in consigning myself to what the RCA deem acceptable routes for the future. ",No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,"[see previous answer] A virtual show would not at all align with the work I have been striving to make for a physical degree show.

What's more, the opportunity to study in London seemed like the logical next step to develop as an artist professionally, to meet people and to be taught by some of the best tutors, who themselves are practicing artists.

",No,Yes,,"Please listen to the student body in their plead to continue education and complete their degree in reasonable, safe and actually achievable circumstances. Do NOT discredit their hard-work of the last 20+ months, where now a transition to new parameters and restrictions in the final 2 or 3 months seems to nullify any and all efforts made in their time at the RCA preceding the pandemic. ","As a practice-based course, access to the studios (an individual space of research and cognitive thought), as well as to the high-end machinery and technical facilities (to which I am once again paying for but not receiving) are VITAL for the completion of my degree. I cannot even come close to completing the body of work I have been striving towards making for the last year and a half, when I do not have access to ANY of the facilities that I would require to do so. I would be entirely compromising and nullifying all the work I have invested in my practice and research over the last 20 months, to produce some digital artwork (a process which does not align with what I have been doing) purely to be compatible with a virtual show, in my final months of study. ",Give us a physical showcase - as with the history of every other RCA alumni! ,"Degree shows posit themselves to allow the chance for artists and designers to battle with challenges of the installation and collective curation of individual projects (a vital experience in developing practice and learning), as well as providing opportunities to further network, exhibit, talk and develop professionally from an exhibition setting. So much satisfaction comes from the completion of a degree show, as well as the numerous other opportunities paired alongside. A virtual degree show closes down so many of these avenues, of which are vital to professional development beyond the RCA for so many students.

We are unable to be in touch with the community of students and staff, to make new contacts and to have access to the studio and facilities— reasons why most people applied and PAYED for the course in the first place. Second years are even more harmed if the work they have been developing does not culminate in a Degree Show, which neither reflects what their practice is nor what the course is. They are being denied an opportunity that every other student in the past had, one that could be important in their careers.

The expense is worth it for what the RCA ordinarily offers, but not for online teaching without access to technical facilities and a digital degree show. While more and more students work digitally, many students will also not have the technical skills for a wholly digital degree show.

During my first winter months at the college there was no heating in our studio, despite incessant emails. Many of us weren't even attending the studio because of the temperature. 

The manner in which senior management treats the students is cold and patronising. Evident from the refusal to speak with student reps whilst occupying the Glassmill building and deciding that a virtual show would replace a physical one without prior discussion (or informing HOPS). 

Ultimately, we want to make work, make friends, be in our studios, develop, do well, but by not postponing the studies, the RCA are making this impossible. I feel time is slipping through my fingers before I have really got going.

There are no guarantees about what the future holds, which is why I believe RCA is trying to move forward with online learning (as the majority of universities around the world are doing). Personally, I have had to move away from London and return to my family in the USA. My father is a physician who has had to cancel all of his vacation time and is on-call for the foreseeable future, and my post-graduation plans of moving to New York City and getting a job as a curator or curatorial assistant are entirely up in the air. For me, it is impossible to postpone graduation and the completion of my degree indefinitely. I do not have the means or emotional stamina to return to London to finish out a project that I have been immersed in over the last year. As disappointed as I am in how this has all transpired, this pandemic is bigger than all of us and whether we like it or not, our plans and visions for the future will have to change. For me, the VERY LEAST that I can now get out of this course is to be able to bring my project to fruition in a thoughtful and responsive online format (whatever format that may be).

I feel that postponing the degree show would put me in particular, in the position of dropping out or opting for a diploma. As I see no possible way that a safe physical exhibition could be provided in the time span of this year, I see online adaptability as the only option we have at the moment. With the financial and Visa situation thrown in to the mix if the show was postponed it would leave me with having to make the unthinkable decision of throwing away the work Ive done in the past almost two years on this course.",No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,"My project exists online and there are artists who I am working with that depend on what I deliver and so am not as affected given the circumstances. So am hoping to continue with the project but if the degree is postponed then I would have to go with other options which would not be as satisfactory. So to cap it of atm, yes.",Yes,Yes,No,No,Maybe,Yes,No,Yes,As I have stated my project is online indigenous. It had physical elements but they have been moved online me and the team of group members that work with me are working tirelessly to realise it to the best of our abilities. Furthermore I personally feel it is too blasé to imagine having a physical show in a couple of months and making any non RCA audience feel secure in showing up and thus feel that the visual show if done properly might be the best option under the circumstances.,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,"Student Visa Expiry Date, Financial, Leaving London / UK, Family commitments",No,,Yes,If this show is delayed I would possibly have no option but to go back home and would possibly not get a job as diplomas are not accepted as an alternative to a two years masters degree. It would mean an absolute wastage of the almost 2 years I've put in for this degree. Given the financial situation looming even if visa are extended without having to go back home I would not have the financial resources to come back or pay more towards rent and all the finances on top of that. A delay or postponement would cater to people who can afford themselves the privilege of continuing their studies perhaps I could find resources but as all family members have been affected and my finances are already in question it does not seem remotely doable. Also I hope to get a job after this degree and have planned to pay back loans not take on newer ones. ,Yes,No,No,"My tutors recommended me to the programme and out of all of my peers I was the only one who had a chance of getting in. The ranking of the University helped secure my visa and finances towards engaging in this course. I did not come with as many illusions of grandeur having understood how universities in the UK operated and even thought the it does not stand in comparison with the homely feel of where I got my BFA. I feel that the course has helped me realise my potential and the brand of the RCA has helped me in incomparable ways and given me a confidence that will stand me in good stead I hope. Could all of this have been better yes, but then again I could say that about anything. ",No,I don't think that my opinion has changed all that much. I feel that problems that are present In the RCA are the same as any of the art institutions Ive ever been involved with. ,No,No,"I hope that my comments help explain my position and are taken with the understanding that coming to these realisations has been exceptionally challenging and though I can not imagine how the majority of creatives are being affected in these times I can help the conversation by clarifying my opinions as I feel that they add a dimension to this conversation that I have not seen voiced. These opinions are however a personal POV as that's what this survey required, My actions will of course be oriented towards the realisation of the goals of the collective but if the decisions were only a detriment to me things would be much different these decisions effect a lot of people and so these opinions had to be aired. To whosoever reads this statement stay safe!","I speak from a position of privilege as I am safe and comfortable delivering an online project  and speak from a position of insecurity of being an international student who sees the wider scope of this situation and for me the uncertainty in postponing is a risk that is problematic but at the same time I am empathetic to the situation of other students who can not work on their projects so I see the duty of care as providing stability which my course tutors are providing admirably given the circumstances, it may just be my course and so my POV.",The RCA was the primary location as site for realisation of my project. Given the circumstances me and my group members are adapting the best we can as we can not imagine stepping in to the RCA in the next however many months we are all engaging in a process of adapting. ,"If it is a question of solidarity then absolutely yes. having a background in sculpture it is unquestionable that I don not understand what a studio means for the artist. I however see solidarity as something more than just the departments that need studios. There needs to be solidarity with the international students that might not have finances to continue their studies beyond established dates, who would possibly not have a visa when the time comes. I feel that delivering what my team is setting out to deliver is showing solidarity with the artists who are dependent on their fees now more than ever as the world heads towards a recession. I see adaptability as the only option as a middle ground between the mentality of ""business as usual"" and of ""doing it at a later date"" should benefit both parties.",In an ideal world a physical show would have given me more opportunities to excel in life post studies but given the circumstances I am working best towards developing my practice and am seeing all of this as a challenge and I think the time Ive put into this field and the effort I'm putting in will shine out.,I would not recommend the RCA as for the international student the fees are incredibly high and the facilities lack lustre but also it lacks a sense of community that liberal arts colleges are known for. There is less a sense of solidarity within the student body college but that might just be my own perspective. It seems that people move on with their agenda without having unbiased conversations which seems the exact opposite of a critical approach. This is not my experience of art schools. The reputation of RCA as allowing everyone to have a voice is thus questionable but the level of enthusiasm and brilliance of the student body are unmatched. I feel that I am studying alongside the best artists and practitioners of my generation and that does attest to the reputation of the RCA. ,I have I think made my position clear. I believe that at this time of great uncertainty a physical degree show is fanciful idea. I would love to be proven wrong for the course to be delayed and to things to go back to normal but can not even in the slightest imagine that happening. This impact of this virus will be there for months if not years and to hold large physical gatherings seems to me a foolhardy approach. Coming from a family of physicians and seeing the devastation of the virus unfold I feel that the purpose of artists is not only to reach audiences but also to ensure the safety of the audience I do not feel that the RCA will be able to provide that within this years time span. So for that reason an all those I laid out earlier I would not be in favour of bycotting the virtual show.,

I think the program should be postponed but only until a good resolution is made concerning the health and safety of all students and also a heavily decreased fee structure (because there are no facilities or equipment or studio) are agreed. You can't charge 1/3 of 30 or 10K for online classes.  

The degree show should be postponed completely till after it is safe to reopen after Covid19. If that means RCA provides students with off site spaces to show then so be it. Virtual show is not good enough. ",Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No because you are not discussing fees.

",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,,,Yes,No,Because I thought I would be able to work interdisciplinary across dpts and I had heard good things 10 years ago. Sadly I did not talk with any current students. Every student I speak to is disappointed with the school. I have not met a single student who thinks the school is impressive. The school seems cold and capitalist. A few teachers have been amazing. Those that are not amazing may have been beaten down my the system it is not clear. The technicians are amazing. ,Yes,When I arrived I was excited. The longer I stay the longer I worry it was a mistake to come to the school. I did not have this experience on my BA or MA. And my friends doing Phds elsewhere do not mirror this dismay. ,No,,The students should also get a a refund for the 3 weeks of strikes. If the teachers aren't being paid then the school should not pocket the fees that students paid for teaching. ,"Im am shocked and appalled that the fees have never been discussed. And the Covid19 email team did not reply to me when I very politely asked about whether there was a fee reduction. Students and their families are facing financial ruin with Covid19 and RCA thinks it can ignore that. 

",,I am a first year. But I think the second year students need support and a physical show when Covid is over. ,,"I think RCA is taking advantage of students. It is far too crowded and you are offering students the least possible for the greatest price. It is a con. I am especially worried for all MA students and for those who are going into debt or their parents are going into debt for a poor education. The world is hard enough. Education is supposed to be a place of freedom, respect and inspiration. I do not see that at RCA. ",It is not for me to comment. I am a first year. ,

They are making us fight for our degree when there are other people fighting to don't let others die. This is a time to focus on other things, not money, not studies. Yes, again, it is their duty because we paid for that. We did our part, we payed them the fees, why don't they do their part and give us what we applied for? Online tutorials don't work when you study Design Products, it is a joke when your tutors ask you to prototype when your house isn't a workshop. When you study Design Products it is also a joke to have a virtual show. I am not studying video-games and I am not doing a speculative-Mars-render project. I am studying Design Products and a field like this one can't be presented this digitally. I don't need their help to publish my project online. We all understood, already, from RCA emails, that what they are writing us are excuses. There is no truth there. I spent some hours thinking on the reasons why a physical show coudn't be an option, as they say, I found no reasons. Makes no sense, it is possible, there are no impossible things. Here it is just a question of being correct to your students, by giving them what they deserve, or being incorrect, by choosing money as a priority. They justify a physical show is not possible as they cant guarantee us what would be the next safe date but on their last email, on the postgraduation option, they say ''you’ll exit the College now, with an award, graduate in the Summer and convocate at the next safe point''. They also justify with the fact that ''many students'' won't be able to come back to London. And are they giving us a one-size-fits-all solution because of that? What about the other many students, like 7000, who signed the petiton against that? RCA is lying on us and that's, again, sad. I would say, almost, ilegal. Now, we, students, we are all lawyers, wanting justice to be done.",Yes,No,No,Yes,No,"RCA is not giving us fair study routes. They are giving us the study routes they want us to take, that's why their options are so not clear. A lie will never make sense. They say they have considered students feedback on the subject but we all know they didn't, otherwise things woudn't be as they are. They say a virtual show is ''imperative'', so they are not giving us routes. They claim that if you do a LoA the course may be different when you come back. No one knows what exactly they mean by that but we all already know RCA so they probably want to say we won't have a physical show. They say online tutorials are an option but thats not an option.

It is our right. Eliminating a physical show because of the Covid is an excuse. An excuse. When we analyse everything again, their emails, we understand that their justifications are excuses. Their sentences make no sense. Give us a physical show later on, when it is safe to do so.

The parts that disppointed me most is not regarding the staff/tutors/college inciatives (like exihibitions/lectures/visiting lectures/student support) but definitely about College management and College response to obvious problems that are against the values they so firmely believe such as, student health and safety...student equalitys/rights...student communication.

In that sense RCA is not the College but the students.,"a virtual show is an alternative for who is able to present work via digital/media and to graduate now. Yet, (for those who can't chose the other options given (Postration/Aegrotat award/ LoA) because they don't have the possibility to stay/return) there should definitely be a open feseable option for who is in a material/object/physical fields to be able to graduate and have a physical show later on when its safe to to so (like the convocation). Regarding the other options (for who has the ability to come back) The show must be present in all the options they have layed out. Because it is a student right. Therefore in options like Postration/Aegrotat award/ LoA they must contain the opportunity to exihibit work at a show when it is same to do so (like, again, the convocation). ",

I thought doing a design master's would provide a supportive environment for me to develop my work, but it almost feels like everything about the College is discouraging me from working.

LACK OF TRANSPARENCY + RESPECT FOR STUDENTS
RCA students are treated like children, and we are kept in the dark about so much. It's a matter of respect - we can handle less-than-ideal situations if we are allowed to understand why and work with the college to come up with the best way forward. I wish RCA would just level with us and say ""we're building a new campus that you probably won't ever see, and a lot of your money is going there but here's what we'll do for you"" or ""we're restructuring our programme right now so we can't say exactly what the course schedule is, but this is what it was last year.""

BASIC FACILITIES NEEDS ARE NEGLECTED
It's shocking to me that basics like elevators, toilet access, window blinds, and space for lectures are missing - and students have to spend energy chasing these things down, only to run into a bureaucratic brick wall. Ex1) I requested ID access to the 7th floor so we could access the toilets there instead of going down from Level 8 to Level 0, was told that it was not possible because of security reasons. No alternative was suggested. Ex 2) My HoP told me that there was a plan to rent more space in South Kensington that fell through, so they needed to rearrange our studio to use as teaching space. Why wasn't there a backup plan?

RELUCTANCE TO IMPROVE
Within my course, I made a number of suggestions of how our course leaders + HoP could support our learning more, and an excuse was made for all of them without a satisfying solution. It got to the point where no one wanted to say anything during our Programme Forum because they knew it was pointless.
This is apparent at the College-level too, based on exchanges I've seen during the strike and the student action that followed.

RESTRICTIVE ACCESS TO SHOPS/STUDIOS
Students don't have 24h access to studios. Booking Moodle consultations and inductions is nearly impossible for some workshops. There isn't enough space to support all students who want to work in different shops.

If a moderate reimbursement plan can be worked out for the lack of services and troubles, I feel it would go a long way in addressing the students' needs due to this shutdown.","Postponing the course universally for all students would be, on the contrary, irresponsible on the part of the college. To expect students to either (1) prolong their stay in London with such a high cost of living, indefinitely, without any purpose or source of income, or (2) expect them to break accommodation contracts, and move all their belongings back home (internationally), put their life on hold, only to return back at an unknown time and search for a base and settle down again, is unimaginably unreasonable.","To all the questions above, it has to be asked with respect to the given situation (Covid-19). Access to college facilities would unarguably produce a higher standard of work / more ambitious projects / intended outcomes. But given the current situation, I am willing to work with the constraints at hand to produce work to I deem to be of high standard.","I don't believe the questions on solidarity are fair and just. I believe everyone should have the options available to them to achieve their desired output. My solidarity with those who require a physical show and facilities cannot come at the cost of worsening my situation. Conversely, I’d ask if those requiring a physical show are in solidarity with me in not having our course delayed, making it impossible to me to complete my course.","A physical show would be very beneficial, but I feel it might not be essential, given the situation.","I'd recommend RCA only disclosing my personal experience, along with the appropriate disclaimers clarifying the shortcomings of the college.","For my situation, I will be able to attend a show at the current timeline or no show at all.

Is sad to see that most of my classmate never showed up in the studio space, plus the talk between year one student are less “academically”, plus I feel we just want to get work done rather than make something good, I believe this is related to age, criteria, and student background.

Strike is one thing but the virus is another thing. In this virus situation, I hope we can collaborate rather than “fight”.","Similar as above, I feel fighting with school is not really a way to solve this, instead, I hope we can work something out e.g. take the online show into different level.

The facilities and staff in charge of technicals are underpaid and could not be bothered to help students because they are not being paid enough.

I also saw some excellent guest speakers. But  many of the lectures on the overall common part of the program (Monday) were disappointing, and the way the Mres was run was often chaotic, with miscommunication from the RCA. We also didn’t have studios for a while, and have cramped studio space. Access to technical workshops was impossible 99% of the time for the first term, and even for the second term, technical workshops and inductions were normally reserved for other programs so it made it very difficult to secure a spot. Technicians were kind and as generous as they could with their time, but they were overstretched. The Head of our Pathway had to handle four times the amount of students of another pathway, she was as generous as she could be with her time and knowledge but it would be fairer for that Head to ensure there are more Tutors to help her, to keep a fair student to tutor ratio across all programs within the Mres. The strikes also placed students in a very difficult position as not only were many classes cancelled, but we also had to decide in between supporting fair salaries and working conditions/contracts for the staff, and access to facilities, or not using technical facilities, including the library, as well as not attending (I had to cancel attending several classes and workshops that I had been greatly looking forward to, and which won’t take place again, as I was told that attending them would mean supporting unfair working conditions in certain cases).",Yes,No,"It would be excellent if there was even greater ethnical diversity amongst the staff, with more varied social, economic and academic backgrounds. There should also be much more studio space for students. We were also shocked to find out that we had to pay for certain classes and workshops, even basic ones. ",,"Financial compensation for the strikes, as well as lack of proper studios for a while, would be ethically and legally fair. Furthermore, we need access to studios, as well as to physical workshops and technical facilities to complete our studies. Because the program has evolved after just a third of the academic year into a digital mode, with no access to studios, workshops and technical facilities, which is not what we paid for, it would be fair and gracious of the RCA to also give us access to its facilities, including the library, and events, for a year after the ending of the degree, as well as the possibility to do a Masters there for with funding for it.",,"We should be given free access to the School’s lectures and workshops, including guest speakers’ lectures, as well as free access to the technical facilities and library, for a year following our graduation. Furthermore, we could be given the option to add another Masters from the RCA to our Mres, with funding from the RCA.","The RCA is fantastic for many things, including the knowledge and expertise of several of its professors and technicians, but it is understaffed, so there is a very big student to teacher ration. Most of the classmates we have, especially the international ones, who pay three times the standard fees, said they were disappointed with the classes and level of student attention they have received.  We have witnessed many internal communication problems. The RCA reputation is thus endangered as many of its local and international students feel disappointed and will spread the message back home. Even artists and alumni such as David Hockney have publicly stated their shock and disappointment in the way the RCA has been handling things. It is a shame as it is such a fantastic institution, and I would love to help it continue to educate and inspire artistic and academic knowledge of the highest standards. ","I understand that we also have to adapt to the current situation. I am not a  two- Masters Student, but I understand that most of them need an physical show, so I suggest that for their graduation show that was meant to happen this summer, you give them the option of doing a virtual show, but in September, and help them find/finance their studios over the summer, so that they can complete their degree?

This would significantly negatively impact my life. 

I think that we should be encouraging a creative and adaptable approach from each other, finding ways to adapt our work and processes and to overcome and support each other above the adversity instead of fighting against the inevitable.

Most questions are focused on the degree show while half the people don’t have a saying yet because they are first years.

However it is not accurate as it is only yes or no questions. Forcing people to either get on board with attacking RCA or be the black sheep. It’s either with us or against us. If you want a true representation of how people feel about the current situation you should allow people to have the option to be indifferent or unsure given that the whole world right now is a mess and no one knows what’s gonna happen. This questionnaire proves nothing other than the fact that the students who designed are unhappy with rca and they are trying to get everyone to say the same, whether we believe it or not.

This is what’s wrong with this school, people having the wrong attitude and getting consumed in their own little bubbles without looking at the bigger picture. ",

It provides structure, food for thought, and and a familiar ritual, which I find grounding. I've been enjoying studying at home. However, it is something I would be doing on my own anyway. What I don't agree with is a digital show. It is a forced, inadequate solution. A physical show should be an opportunity for all students who want one.

",Yes,"I thought it would be like Hogwarts. I thought it would be like this magical place where teachers and students mingled, shared ideas, and created wonderful works and relationships. Instead, teachers are reluctant to provide outside of class because they feel taken advantage of by the institution. Students feel unsupported, lost, and frustrated. The community is stressed and fractured. 

In IED students were promised hands on skill training and there has been none. We lost our HoP in October and the department has been scrambling since then. We feel it. I'm a self starter and still, my best projects to date were made before I entered school. I remain hopeful but I'm very jaded at this point. ",No,Yes,,"Briefly, as a student, I do not feel acknowledged by senior management. I do not feel like a priority. And I do not feel confident that the intentions of senior management's decision making process are towards my betterment, in part because I don't know what they are. Their goals, drivers, and process are a black box. I feel like I have no agency within my own organization. It's an echo chamber. My relationship with the institution appears more like a customer than a student. To that end, customer service quality is quite poor. My local gym has treated me better. Their communications were clear and concise. They solicited feedback. And they gave me reimbursement options, which I declined because I care about them. I don't feel the same about this administration. ","The school has done a lot to establish a robust online learning experience and I appreciate that. However, it's no match for face-to-face schooling. Digital schooling is much less effective and as a result the quality of my learning has decreased significantly. Therefore, I think reparations are in order. Not because the school isn't trying to teach digitally but because digital schooling is inherently inadequate and when we initially contracted with the school we agreed to higher standards. ",,,,,

3/29/2020 2:01:07,laurene.pilastre@network.rca.ac.uk,Laurene Pilastre,School of Communication,2nd Year,Information Experience Design MA,EU,No,Yes,"It seems pretty obvious that current students who chose to come to the RCA to study have paid their fees in order to have access to RCA particular facilities, equipments, resource stores, studios accesses, technicians advices and help, workshops, physical teaching and tutorials, lectures and above all a sense of community and network, meeting students within RCA PHYSICAL premises.
Due to the actual pandemic, the services the RCA is normally offering are not accessible anymore. Thus it seems absurd to ask students to carry on with their work and planned deadline as they were expected to before the lockdown.
This causes confusion, more stress as the exams and end of the year approach and a sense of distress, profound frustration and anger that the school does not understand and support its students.
Moreover, above the closing of the school, it seems that the RCA is disregarding the crucial fact that worldwide people are getting affected by the pandemic, on an emotional level, on a physical level, on a family level, in short on so many levels.
Due to the sole event of Covid-19, a lot of distress, sadness, anxiety is understandably stir up.
The school, by the poor decisions it took regarding the digitalisation of all teaching, degree show, disregarded any impacts the pandemic already had on students and put them in more stress, adding some workload within the midst of a lockdown, we suddenly had to reorganise our way of studying, highly disrupting our habitual ways of studying at the RCA that added to the feeling of ambient chaos and confusion, making us unable to cope with the current pandemic and rapid change of landscape from the social distancing to the lockdowns, preventing us to be able to fully commit and participate in any social action that could help local communities, NHS or simply adjusting to this big shift in our daily lives and routine. This is RCA duty to assure students well-being within their studies! Especially in an artistic community! ",Yes,No,No,Yes,No,"The RCA is not appropriately dealing with the current situation.
In my opinion, the options RCA offered their students reflect a lazy, coward, extorsion of money led management team.
There should really be 2 options given to students if the RCA had a rational, ethical and moral understanding of the situation:
1- The RCA will refund part of their fees to the students as they can't deliver the teaching conditions students agreed to when enrolling to the RCA. This is a breach of contract.
2- The RCA is suspending all studies until the college is able to re-open, function as it did prior to the strikes and that students are able to continue studying under the normal conditions that were offer to them by the time they agreed to when enrolling to the RCA.
",No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,"NO
Art is sensual, needs to be physically experienced, with the senses, with the eyes, the ears, the sense of smell and that of taste.
We are physical beings, we cannot give an experience to be lived solely through the eyes, on a flat, lifeless computer screen, no reliefs, no details, no depths or space to go around and within the work, to get away and/or get closer if the audience wishes/is invited to.
As well as my work involved a workshop, a space in which the audience is invited to participate and EMBODY the themes I am working on.
Moreover, I am an IED students, that stands for INFORMATION EXPERIENCE DESIGN, thus my practice and expertise (and the practice of my peers) rely on IMMERSIVE, MULTI-MODALS EXPERIENCES.
VIRTUAL is simply not the medium to express and exhibit it.
Also because since Year 1 we worked with the idea of a PHYSICAL degree show.",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,,No,Yes,No,"I chose to study at the RCA for its PHYSICAL facilities and for the great creative networks and professionals that are linked with the schools. It was a FULL TWO YEARS opportunity to develop my practice within an environment in which I had access to a great deal of services, workshops, spaces to work in, people to work and collaborate with, equipment to learn and use. Facilities I could not access if I wasn't a student. 
One of the key aspect that decided me to study at the RCA was going to the degree show and seeing students work being exhibited and in conversation with one another within the school. The degree show was advertised through posters across the whole London last year. An influence that isn't negligible for someone like me who wishes to become an artist that can make a living from her artistic practice.",Yes,"Several changes this year made me drastically review my opinion of RCA, I have to say my opinion of the school got more and more mediocre as the year went down.
The close down of the Student cafe, a crucial space for RCA community and space to relax, freely and informally meet people and students of the school, get a GOOD warm meal; the close down of one of the metal workshop in Kensington; the sudden, unexpected leave of IED HoP with a very confused, unplanned transition that lasted the whole first term, leaving students lost and disoriented facing an unstructured schedule. Loosing all the valuable contact our HoP had with exterior professionals and RCA technicians and diverse workshops and resources. Then the strikes happened and I was infuriated to learn about staff working conditions, wage gap and so on, knowing how much the students have to spend to study in such a ""prestigious"" institution. And to finish up, RCA heatless, dehumanised response to the pandemic, refusing to close the school, not informing students, HoP or it seems anyone about their decision to forget about a physical degree show and their outrageous emails informing the students about their ""choices"" to continue their studies within the pandemic. 
The lack of transparency (how convenient to sign emails off by ""Covid-19 Academic Response Group"" so we can't connect with any real person to ask for more explanations), this frighteningly resembles to Naomi's Klein Shock Doctrine theory.
The incessant shameless pretending from RCA management team, the sham makes me feel I am being gaslighted by an institution I am paying to obtain services from. It is exhausting.",No,Yes,,"This is an absurd situation, the decisions of the RCA have a negative impact on student well-being, RCA has currently puts us in a situation in which their duty of care is not non-existent but if graded, would have to exist in the minus spectrum of any notation scale. ","So far in IED, the ""digitalisation"" of RCA premises seems to be a few zoom meetings per week. (And how could it be done any other way considering the current pandemic?)
That alone should be enough for the school to realise that students cannot currently study under appropriate conditions.
I am in my final year of study within the RCA, my final year project is in peril because of RCA decisions to continue the year as if nothing has changed.
I cannot get access to technicians, metal, resin, wood workshops, I need photography and moving image studios, I need photography and moving image technicians advises and valuable opinions when I come in their office, show them some videos, some props or sketch an idea while they can see me explain it. I need the support of my peers, a community that foster exchanges and creativity to pursue my project and feel some emulation. I need access to cameras, microphones, projectors. And I need access to a high powered computer so I can use Rhino, Cinema 4D, Premiere Pro, and to be able to render my work.
All of this I cannot access, nor work with currently.
How am I suppose to currently carry on my study, complete my final year project within 2 months left, when I am sitting at home unable to develop my work.","I came into the RCA being aware of the high quality and reputation of its yearly PHYSICAL degree show. That was what was offered to me when I enrolled. And the RCA should aim to deliver it. Even if it is, understandably postponed such as similar large scale events are being rescheduled in other schools, establishments around the world due to the pandemic.
Also the switch from a physical degree show to a virtual one is a huge shift that even under normal circumstances would be highly disturbing and confusing to students. As we don't have any resources left to work and continue our work, it just seems incoherent to implement a new format that would induce significant last minute modifications and redrafting. How can one operate such alterations in such a context?! This is a highly distressing situation imposed to final year students.","Through my studies at RCA my portfolio core piece was going to be my final year project, this feels like an amputation of my practice. Furthermore, the experience of the final year degree show is an experience that is very impactful in students practice and expertise and a one time opportunity to be able to encounter, discuss our work and build our network. It shouldn't be overlooked as it currently is by the college.",,"Personally, I am currently thinking of submitting a kind of protest project, tailored for the virtual show, highlighting RCA deceitful policy.",

On the previous page there is a question: Will you be able to create a strong enough portfolio to enter professional life without further access to RCA facilities? - this should not be the question because you can ALWAYS create a stronger portfolio, and this is what I came to the RCA to achieve, but again, they need to recognise what we are losing, even just acknowledge that we are not going to get as much out of this as we hoped now that it is remote.

Or there could be mini shows every week, that slowly show the work that would have been in the summer 2020 show.

Maybe there could be an ""artist is present"" area and then digital visitors could talk in real time to the artist.

Art and design however are fields that cannot progress through digital learning. They require in-person interactions, feedback, experience and understanding to be able to critically articulate, understand and reflect. Furthermore the hands-on nature of the output require workshops that are no longer accessible. Perhaps, if the RCA cannot offer students an extension, they can case-by-case offer longer-term access to workshops beyond their studies. Furthermore, postpone the show for those who wish to participate at the next best given opportunity.

I feel powerless and even a little bit scared to be filling in this survey. However I do appreciate the intention of what is being done here. Thank you to those working towards a future solution. You efforts are greatly appreciated and I feel like someone who empathises with me is listening.","Like mentioned, there isn't a one answer fits all for everyone.

Students shouldn’t feel pressured to take a short leave of absence and not have that additional to make up (re 3 weeks added to the end)?when a global pandemic is happening. Moving house, traveling under extreme duress and in highly stressful situations, moving work stations and working under quarantine are incredibly challenging conditions for even the strongest people. While expectations have been slightly lowered, that does not ultimately help the people and their work which should be to a high degree as the work is what reflects in the portfolio, not our reviews. Suspension is the only logical, sane, and humane answer during this crisis. In addition to RCA’s mismanagement of this crisis, I am completely and utterly disappointed with this uni. Since day one of 1st year, everything including basic studio conditions (i.e. heating, working printers, etc.) have been a battle by the students to gain what they have rightfully paid for and been promised. Students attend RCA to learn (and pay high INTERNATIONAL fees, 3x the other unis I was accepted into) not to fight for their basic rights. I can never say to another international student, yes, I got what I paid for. Never ",Yes,No,No,Yes,"Absolutely not. Incredibly disappointing, cowardly, and poorly articulated. For people who write an incredible amount, they seemingly never get to a concrete, helpful answer to even the most basic questions. ","No option to postpone the semester at all other than being forced into a leave of absence. Many of us do not want to take a leave of absence, we simply just want more time to complete projects and have a real show (when safe to do so). Extreme stress of this crisis (for me packing up my flat in a day, international traveling during a pandemic, and being under quarantine - all still better than being stuck in the UK to then study online...) has been a lot and really affected my current work. I am incredibly disappointed that the uni also took so long to make concrete decisions because me and my flatmate had to act fast, before any announcements of uni going online and shutting were made to even get back to our countries before travel bands prevented us from doing so. RCA’s lack of foresight and concern for its high percentage of international students is appalling - what level of care is that!

Thank you so much ",No,Yes,No,"My program, Interior Design and it's more creative, open and forward thinking approach to architecture and design. Then followed by the school's reputation. I highly regret choosing the school for reputation and prestigious alumni (I now know it had very little to do with the school itself). ",Yes,"I spent way too much of my own time last year and this year fighting for a basic studio right: heating. Yes you read that right, two years, same issue. How you can possibly ""clear"" a studio for occupation without having proper heating is shocking but then to ignore the problem for years is incredibly incompetent, unsafe, and ""unfit for purpose"". This is not the job of a student. 

In addition, while the school claims to give you access to so many facilities, it's near impossible to utilise all those facilities, especially those outside your department, school or even campus. Trying to individually contact each technician to see if you MAYBE by some miracle of a chance can get into a specific facility and then MAYBE use those areas, does not help diversity or broaden your horizons. It's actually incredibly difficult to use other workshops other than those for your program and use them well. Moodle has helped from last year but many are often ""email technician for availability"".  

The facilities I often use - wood, metal, casting, laser are often HIGHLY overwhelmed and near impossible to use unless you plan 2 weeks in advance (with project deadlines and not knowing how a project will turn out that early in advance makes it near impossible to project if you'll actually need the slot or not) and or wait outside the shops in long queues, especially during review times. I'm often queueing alongside my own classmates for sometimes hours. I have to say that all the technicians I've worked with and most of the teaching faculty have been amazing. The administration, building and estates and management (management re: workshops but not technician management, overall) are appalling. What are they even being paid for?!?! When I repeatedly tell you printers are not working, give you precise locations and machines, and I'm told to ""email this email"" and that numbers speak louder than continued verbal complaints in rep meetings which results in a week later's response of ""no problems, issue resolved""  is mind boggling and infuriating. The printer is clearly not working for a few hours or a day - this is something that needs to be addressed when there is the issue, not a week later. 

A lot of my time as a student has been fighting battles that should not have to be fought by a student, let alone faculty. Administration should get it's act together and truly live up to the uni's reputation and the expectations it gives students. 

As an American, I'm appalled that that the uni hasn't been aggressively reported on by the media. If this happened in the US, it would be no doubt be reported by major news outlets : ""How your tuition actually is spent at the #1 art and design school in the world: what went wrong"" ",No,Yes,Thank you very much for putting this together and also fixing the tech issues.

We are only one term away from our scheduled graduation. It is really not ideal and frustrating to continue working under such an awkward condition where we can't possibly produce physical works, which is very important for my platform, without having access to our studios and workshops.

Let's just solve this problem objectively and impersonally. The only truth is we have to embrace the situation now.

My opinion is let's figure out how to push RCA to do the best on the virtual show, how to make it better than a stupid instagram, how to innovate a new way of online exhibition, and provide a postponed show on autumn term for those who cannot fulfil the virtual one.

First option is when outbreak situation is a bit better, the school could be opened for curtain groups of people at a time to work on their projects, which could be done by booking only to control number of people accessing the school.
(The school have to make sure to provide benefits for staffs who come to work at the critical time and provide protection like masks.)

 Second option is to pay compensation to students to deal on the problems while they are isolated, they might have to send drawings to workshops outside the school, get it built and deliver back to them.",I understand the current situation is really unpredictable.

I don’t think postponement indefinitely will work for everyone. I think RCA’s duty of care requires management to find solutions that work for all students and this will vary depending on whether you are in first or second year and on what programme you are enrolled on. For example, I want to continue with the dissertation at this time rather than have it postponed but agree that it makes sense to postpone studio based practice IN THE SHORT TERM as we can’t access any facilities, studios, materials etc. Although I don’t necessarily want to write it, the dissertation is part of the reason why I chose to come to college. For some first years I think it may make more sense to complete dissertation and progress to second year and get compensation / refund for the second half of the first year which we have missed as a result of strikes and COVID-19.

There needs to be an option where we either: receive the value of the course which we agreed to pay our fees for i.e. space to create, teaching in person, the opportunity to hand in and have our dissertation marked, OR we should receive a full reimbursement of the fees for our summer term which has been massacred.

When a University makes it very clear to us that they don't care about it's teaching staff i.e. not stopping the strikes from lasting an entire months and allowing them to disrupt paying students' education, they don't care about their students and the impact this pandemic has had on all of us, they have little or no regard for the fact that students' who have already paid to attend their university are asking for something possible: opening the school in the summer (Pandemic considering) and instead announces a whole new intake of students for the summer schools! I think it is completely abhorrent. I don't feel that the University is in any way deserving of its ""Number 1 worldwide"" status as a result of the poor way it has handled everything in this year. ",No,Yes,No,I chose the RCA for the reputation of the incredible tutors on the MA Painting course; the approach to painting study that the course takes; the prestige of attending a university which (I thought) respected the arts and requirements of artists in pursuing their professional careers; and the community that the painting course prides itself on developing over the 2 years. ,Yes,"I never expected to find out that the higher ups have absolutely no appreciation for how much we depend on the physical, in-person learning that artists require in order to benefit the most from the course. It saddens me to think that the higher ups think digital learning is an adequate alternative for a course which many of us have sacrificed so much for. 

Everything that the RCA claims to pride itself on in achieving the worlds number 1 status - the quality of teaching, impossible to achieve digitally; the apparent “ability to evolve” as quoted by Paul Thompson, not something that’s been demonstrated in any way in the face of this pandemic - this year has demonstratively been set aside in favour of raking in as much money as possible from its students.

The only thing that the RCA can still hold its head up and say it still has is an incredible collection of compassionate, dedicated, hard working tutors. And yet, the lack of care the RCA has shown towards its teaching staff (at this point their most valuable asset, if not the only one left) during the strikes and their negligence towards the students in their lack of action which allowed the strikes to disrupt an entire month of teaching! The only reason I would ever recommend the RCA to prospective students would be for it’s teaching staff, and if it carries on acting the way it has done this year, I’m quite confident it won’t have any left. ",Yes,Yes,"I feel like the “options” we have been provided with do not have clear outlines of the affect it would have on us if we took any of them. All of the communication received from the RCA has been conveniently ambiguous. I would feel uncomfortable choosing an option without further clarification, more information so that I can make a fully informed choice. 

I also feel like the RCA is totally disregarding the far reaching impact this pandemic has had on so many students and staff alike. I think it’s completely unfair to expect teaching staff to continue with online tutorials to students, many of whom are experiencing very traumatic events and who are suffering with their mental health deeply as a result of that. These are teachers, not counsellors. They shouldn’t be expected to have to continue to provide teaching to people who are panic-stricken, trapped in quarantine, recently unemployed, have family members who are sick. Not only this, but it is unfair to expect that any of these options are suitable for the students, many of whom have had to take great sacrifices to attend the university this year, many of whom want to continue with their studies but simply can’t concentrate due to the stress of this entire situation, many of whom cannot easily “take a leave of absence” and “come back next year”. Quite frankly, that last option is just insulting. 

The RCA forget that they are dealing with humans, not bags of money. ",,,,,,,

However I have been unable to accept the RCA's response to this situation. My mental health and well being has been more affected by the failure of RCA to engage with students to come to an agreement of how studies should continue.

I feel heart broken that the school believes students are more concerned with ""passing"" and receiving a degree document rather then receiving the tuition and physical degree show. 

As a first year student I have only received 17.5 weeks of study in a 34 week year. One month of which was impacted by staff strikes. This time is an essential loss to my progress as an artist. Because this has not been addressed or acknowledged, I have lost my faith in the RCA as the number one art and design school. It does not feel like the school care for the education the students receive, but rather just that they pass. I am unsatisfied that the school have not even tried to compromise or adjust the usual running of the next academic year so that students this year can finish their degree with a physical show and 1st years can make up for lost time.

On top of that the program I am on, has not come equipped with the basic facilities in the studios such as; hot running water, kettle, microwave, or fridge. In fact the kettle and microwave that were placed there broke within weeks of starting and were last checked in 2018 (as signed on the equipment by estates). Studios have been impacted by infrastructural damage such as severe leaks in studios. The schools desire to capitalise on summer classes meant that studios (roofs and windows) were not fixed and equipment not updated. This is a very poor standard for the No.1 Art and Design school.   ",No,Yes,,,,,,RCA have sadly demonstrated through their actions to staff and students in this exceptional time (and even prior to this based on studio degradation and overcrowded studio spaces) that their ethos is based on capital revenue NOT delivering quality education.  ,As a first year student I cannot boycott the virtual show but I stand in solidarity. ,

If we cannot put a time limit to this virus, why are changes being made as quickly as possible, the situation is being taken advantage of and it is very obvious. 

RCA is enforcing students to bear all the cost of risk, inconvenience, and uncertainty. Students are in a way biggest customers, contributing 55% of the RCA income (tuition fees, etc GBP41,000,000 for total income GBP74,000,000), according to the 2019 financial report on RCA website. We deserve better. A huge amount of that money goes towards the result of a physical degree show. The RCAs terms and conditions when I accepted this degree clearly stated that the RCA should consult students before making changes to the course, this virtual replacement of a degree and online ‘tutorials’ was uploaded to the RCA website with no warning or debate. A tutorial is a conversation in-front of an artwork about the artwork and things connecting the artwork. The idea of a zoom, Skype, Whats App, FaceTime as a tutorial is to not understand what the term means in this context - It’s not a you-tube tutorial on how to draw a puppy. It is absolutely essential that art should be experienced in person, in a safe environment, and a virtual education and exhibition is an insulting proposal and a flimsy solution.  Other organisations are offering practical assistance to the people affected by this covid-19 situation, either partial refund or fee-waiver.The people making these decisions should ask themselves, do you think students would have signed the contract and paid their tuition fees if they'd have thought the RCA would have responded to the pandemic in this way? Whether we expected the pandemic or not, it really is shocking. We are in a contract. We don't only deserve better, we are legally entitled to a postponement or a reimbursement - we will not let this go.",Yes,No,No,Yes,No,,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,,,Yes,No,Because I thought RCA were passionate in supporting students in their individual needs in regards to their practises.,Yes,"I feel really shocked how decisions have been made so quickly without even consulting any lecturers.

Instead of mentioning fees, and highlighting that the RCA management are aware of the issue of money and compensation, they blanket ignored it. RCA seems to blanket ignore any issues that may be against them, or needing to be carefully discussed. This feels deeply patronising and a very managerial business way to approach questions within education. I have found RCA management incredibly inept with all forms of communication, and to be honest I've been embarrassed by their handling of the covid-19 response on the website and via email.

Where's my week's worth of education this week? ,,"The only 'online learning' I have been offered is ONE 45 minute tutorial. I have no new work to show, so this will be a chat. There is one drop-in CHS surgery. That's it. No other options in which to 'learn online'. They can't create a whole education system that was time in the studio - but RCA are telling us to take 'online learning'. Where is that exactly? It's wordplay and nothing more. Deeply patronising and frustrating. My flatmate is doing an academic MA at LSE. She is doing online learning. Monday-Friday she is watching new online lectures, having post lecture seminars, and completing writing projects and academic work for these online classes, like she would at LSE if it were open. The RCA is offering us nothing in which to learn from - but is telling us the emperor's clothes exist so they don't have to postpone our studies. Then threatening us with 'not the same experience' so we don't take a year out in our droves. RCA management is a cold hearted business, and cares nothing for whats right and honest. ","You cannot try and invent Instagram. It exists. To take 19 thousand pounds from artists as a minimum and blanket refuse to try and find a new way of working this problem is appalling. The RCA will never be financially bankrupt, but its reputation may well be. Im sure the senior management will all move on to other very well paid jobs. "," The problem is the financial exchange. RCA is incredibly expensive. We pay because it's supposedly such a good education. Great facilities, great technicians, great tutors. But the burden of spending and borrowing is incredibly high. We are paying to learn, so become better artists, and to have the opportunity to make things with machines and technicians that we wouldn't ever have access to. (High frequency welder for example). Studios exist because its so difficult to make work in your bedroom (turpentine while you sleep anyone?), so the 2nd years having to make degree show worthy work, that no-one will engage with, in their bedroom, with boorish announcements from the RCA on the website about Summer Schools, about studio closings with 2-hours notice (luckily we were petitioning for RCA to close earlier - like Boris Johnson's announcement late to isolate- everyone already was), its heartbreaking. RCA are loosing the trust of all the future artists, and loosing the trust of their student body. Their lack of generosity and openness to discussion about logical problems art students face over academic is absurd. In this time of world-wide crisis, the fact that more than 7000 people have signed the petition should give them great pause. ",I've had people I barely know sending me messages saying - I'm sorry I heard you're at the RCA. Poor you. Are you alright? This has happened 7 times. Says a lot. ,"I think the students will find a way to show their work, and if RCA forces their hand to do this outwith the RCA umbrella, then they are business idiots. ",

The solo exhibition and what I want to show at my degree show is based on the dissertation I wrote in first year.,I've met some incredibly talented artists studying alongside me and some tutors that were exceptional. BUT that's it. I could have got this at another institution that I know would support me more and show respect.,"Even if I was in support of the ridiculous idea of a virtual show, I can't participate. Phone pictures of my prints (that are only suitable as instagram stories) are obviously not suitable.

We have all paid £20,000 + + in hopes that the studios, workshops, state of the art facilities, face to face tutorials & advice from established & admired creative professionals all leading to the pivotal moment of our degree show would be worth it.

To call the new options that the RCA have given us “exceptional” makes a mockery of all that the students have sacrificed in order to be there, A joke out of the time & hard work they have already put into their courses.

Along side the studios & workshops, incredible tutors & visiting lecturers, I hoped for the interrupted time to create & discover my practise.

Students are telling the RCA it is impossible to make work with online tutorials, where students and staff cannot physically assess work, no crits, no workshop space, no access to materials, no technical support, no remote access to computer programmes (my laptop can’t run them), and feeling in a constant state is anxiety and stress because of the lockdown and uncertainty of covid-19. But the RCA is not listening or acting with compassion. They should have a duty of care. ",Yes,No,No,Yes,No,"Senior management has insultingly offered ‘exceptional study routes’ which still do not offer us a physical degree show, but essentially say:
1. ‘leave soon by making work which is unsatisfactory or representational of your practice for an unsatisfactory and non representational virtual degree show’
2. ‘Stop all studies now and still make work that is unsatisfactory or representational of your practice for an unsatisfactory and non representational virtual degree show’
3. ‘Or leave now with a loss of credits and half an MA degree with no virtual degree show.’
All of these options do not compensate for the money and energy we have put into our RCA experience and I believe them to ALL break the contractural terms of agreement for studying at the RCA. We lose so much emotionally, financially and academically by accepting any one of these ‘exceptional’ options. RCA seniors management should be ashamed of themselves ",No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,"It would be impossible to present my video installation virtually. Firstly, I need to use the film studios with the proper lighting, equipment and technician support to film my moving image. I also need the one -on-one assistance and expertise of technicians in after effects to help edit to the standard I want, how could I be able to communicate what I want remotely? My computer at home cannot even support large programmes such as adobe premier pro, so I need the editing suite to be able to edit at all! With creating the installation, I need access to materials which I cannot get now art shops have closed. I do not have studio space to create the scale and effect I need, let alone the equipment to show the video: projector or media player or monitor. And to test my work, it would need physical contact with tutors and students to give satisfactory feedback, so I would not be able to develop the work critically enough to make it something I’m proud to represent me in the degree show. And lastly, I do not have the space, the camera or the lighting to professionally photograph the work for a virtual show EVEN if I was able to make ANY of it. ",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,,No,Yes,No,"To further my career as an artist, to have incredible tutorship, progress my creative practice to a professional standard, meet likeminded creatives, have a prestigious physical degree show to help me into more creative and professional opportunities, have the time to enjoy studying and learning again. ",Yes,"Tutorship has been fantastic and so have VLs. But they are not connected to the RCA upper management and have themselves been disrespected with insulting pay rates and lack of rights. They have had to strike to protect themselves against bad contracts and bad wages. RCA upper management does not respect the people who work for them who are the ONLY people who make the experiences of the students worthwhile. I do not respect the RCA upper management and institution. I am insulted that I have paid so much but have not had an easy time with accessing resources across departments to make the work I wanted to. Bad systems such as Moodle and the previous systems too have been huge obstacles in accessing technical help and resources in time. The tiny studio spaces across the school and LACK of studio spaces for many courses have been hugely disruptive for students in making work and building creative communities. This is appalling. The lack of materials in the Dyson school shop is shocking. I cannot buy the basic materials I need to make work, it’s opening hours of 3 hours a day is ridiculous and it’s prices are hardly competitive with other art shops. This is unacceptable with helping students get the materials to make the work they need to. The canteen at the RCA is appalling, the food options and quality is disgusting and limited and it’s environmental impact extremely negative - they need to reduce their single use plastic! The lack of a student union bar at the Dyson has meant that there is a huge lack of community in the building. I have not had the vital chance to mix with other creatives, year groups and courses that students need to further themselves socially and professionally. And finally (as I could go on forever with my dissatisfaction with the rca) my opinion of the RCA has plummeted from the lack of compassion, leadership and intelligence from senior management in arranging the course of our degree show and studies in this global crisis. They have denied us the most important part of our degree, which is a physical degree show, and continue to make us pay the same price of tuition for remote learning which disallows us access to workshops, studios and community engagement. All of which are VITAL in making artwork. I am shocked disheartened and angry to say the least.",No,Yes,,,,,,,,

Therefore, in the same way that most other service providers across other industries are providing their customers with refunds or credit notes for redemption in future,  so should the RCA be either reimbursing fees, or allowing fees paid to be credited against the next year of teaching.

The scant communication we have received from the college has been patronising, dismissive, and dangerously slow and infrequent. The school has put the health and lives of their students, staff and the wider population at risk by staying open for far too long when there were many suspected cases that it was well aware of. It is now putting the mental health of its student and staff in grave and unnessecary risk but behaving so cruelly during what is an exceptionally stressful time for all.

However the way this particular situation was handled reached a new low level.

",I find it tough to focus on anything related to the RCA due to negative association with the college and the way the circumstances were handled. I find it tough to focus on making art in this stressed and heightened environment where majority of the focus for me and my fellow students is on having to deal with the fallout created by RCA. Additionally I am not interested in virtual learning.,"The virtual degree show would require a change of practice altogether, as I currently have no-media content. And no time or financial resources are available at this stage for creating new work based around the requirements for the online presentation. It centrally is not possible in the two months allocated by the RCA, as we are do not know what to expect, furthermore RCA has zero experience in conducting such endeavour. An introduction of a virtual show should be tried and tested during a calm state of global affairs, and be first presented alongside a physical show. No cohost of students should be used a 'test subjects' without sufficient back up of a safety net of a tested method. It is my option that too much is at steak for all involved.

It is actually making me more stressed having this added pressure in a time when anxiety is high globally and it should be our health we are caring for.  ,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Although I can appreciate they have given us a choice of different pathways I do not feel the RCA has listened to its students as much as Slade and the RA school has. They have been given the option of a physical degree show in different forms depending how the situation is in the future which is not one of our options. ,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,,Yes,I think we could get really creative with how we exhibit the work physically if we were not given any studio space in the RCA. Maybe an RCA degree show map that crosses london? (like an artlick weekend?),No,,No,Yes,No,To engage with other students and the tutors to stimulate interesting discussions as well as the RCA's facilities. I also thought the exposure you get at the degree show helps lead to further exhibitions etc that shapes your career. ,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,,,This could be a chance for students to put on a very exciting and different physical degree show than the normal format at the RCA. Even if we had an external space that was smaller it could be rotated with other departments or even completely mixed up with the other departments or create some kind of RCA map of locations around london that spans over one weekend? I feel the physical degree show is so important that it would not even need to be on for as long but just to have something!,,"I did recommend the RCA to a student who was contemplating applying. She then decided to apply and has since been accepted. I have been regretting encouraging her as she had already been warned about the RCA not living up to what it was made out to be and I was telling her the course is what you can make of it. At the moment I feel there is no course at all and I am usually quite an optimistic person. 

I feel that although I will never stop making work whatever life throws at you it is unreasonable for the RCA to expect people to be able to make work that is of a standard that is good enough and lives up to your own personal standards in this current situation. At the moment, making for me is about mental wellbeing. the added stress of having to produce something you are proud of is very very overwhelming and anxiety inducing. Given that the RCA is supposedly the best art school in the world I am very surprised that they are not caring for their students mental well-being.

I do not even know when the virtual degree show would be? Even by telling students that this show would be later in the year would ease stress, but I feel we are being left to stand alone when this is a time people should be supporting each other and coming together. 

I originally felt honoured to have been accepted into the 'worlds best art college' but now I feel disappointed at how quickly that reputation will have been lost. In years to come it does not feel like the college will be such an impressive and desirable place to go which makes me very sad as I want to still be able to recommend it. ","I would be more than happy to boycott the virtual show. If the RCA does not give us a physical show I would still want some way of presenting the work, and I think this should be a platform built solely by the students where their work is uploaded and nothing to do with the RCA helping. Each year peoples work gets put up online anyway to help promote it so being offered a 'virtual show' just is code for 'robbing you of a physical show'.",

And tutors are alight but for the 1st art college in the world, I would not say that I came here to study under someone I looked up to so much from before, which I feel is something one would expect from the 1st art college, to be looking forward to have this person or that person for tutor and be inspired by them and their practise.

Sadly this makes any of their decisions to be inspected for trickery and dismissed as diminishing. ,"All my work is locked up in the RCA. even if I was to 'digitise it' I don't have it with me, i don't have a camera, and i don't have space to set it up in. Also my final show was supposed to be a smell experience installation: how can I make this virtual????","It is a difficult decision and I acknowledge the larger picture, I am just not ok with RCA pocketing our money and waving goodbye without delivering what promised. I find it a rip off and very offensive. ","I have been building up to this for long time now and everything is almost there but not, sO I want to at least finish up my work and if not physical degree show to have it ready to show elsewhere. I can do this if offered to use facilities as alumni, or refund so i can pay outsourcing stuff.

",Yes,No,No,Yes,No,"I didn't feel like it was an email I could trust. I don't like how the university has presented these as options when for me I have no choice and therefore no options. I can only continue my education online: firstly, I don't understand why I would take a term off that I have paid for without any clarification of financial benefits, secondly, the LOA for the year is only available for students who have underlying health, mental health, financial issues as well as coronavirus (of which I don't have).

3/30/2020 14:15:00,sophie.kemp@network.rca.ac.uk,Sophie Kemp,School of Art & Humanities,2nd Year,Sculpture MA,Home,,Yes,"Other types of educational institutions in this country, to the best of my knowledge, have suspended teaching and assessment, with the exception of schools remaining open to support the children of key workers and the most vulnerable children. This is a reflection of the unprecedented situation we find ourselves in, not only locally but internationally. 

As commented on by an Indian doctor and re-tweeted by Jon Snow, news reporter for channel 4 news, the instructions to self-isolate to reduce the spread of the virus are well-intentioned and backed by medical science, but only fully achievable to those who are privildged to have a safe home and financial security to not work during this time. The impact of the pandemic is not felt evenly across the globe, and it will not be felt evenly across the college community, who represent a range of nationalities and class backgrounds. 

Attempting to carry on, with a deferral option for those who cannot work in the current conditions, is, in my opinion, a fundamentally classist division of the community, which essentially says that if you have anything like caring responsibilities and precarious situations in your life, you just have to accept suspending your education and re-joining next year, where you will have no option but to accept the conditions and fees of the time. Deferrals due to caring responsibilities must be able to have the same fees on returning, at the very least, otherwise we are essentially being charged for being disadvantaged.

I do not think it is acceptable to expect student support, as brilliant as it is, to deal with what I expect to be a deluge of need. These people who work in student support have needs too, at this time, and should be supported to have time off to attend to them too. I appreciate the situation is very difficult for international students who need to finish this year, and my comments may contravene what they feel they need. I think fundamentally my point is that these students should have specific support to carry on - ie the college should be fundraising, or the government should, to give them free accommodation in London so they can return and finish their studies.",Yes,No,No,Yes,It is hard to know what they are supposed to offer.,,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,There is very little information about what the format of a virtual show would be - it could be anything. How are we to know what this will look like? We have known what our degree show spaces will look like for 2 years. ,Yes,It is impossible to know what my work would need for a virtual show at this time. ,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,No,,,,No,Yes,No,All the technicians that supported me at Chelsea College of Arts studied at RCA. They provided the most valuable teaching support I have ever received at any instituion.,Yes,"Having recently studied at Chelsea College of Arts I have found the RCA's whole method and approach to be very dated and out of touch with contemporary issues and needs of artists, and completely lacking in any formal awareness of pedagogical approach. It is as if they think by filling the buildings with amazing equipment and well-qualified people, somehow the knowledge of these will just somehow magically 'flow' into the students, without realising that we need the right conditions for these resources to be available to us for learning, and the teachers need the right conditions to be able to teach. Having loads of equipment which you can never access because there are not enough technicians and enough time slots, refusing to acknowledge the pre-existing learning of students and allowing them to build on it by insisting they are not allowed to use tools they know perfectly well how to use, and not allowing or paying teachers so they have enough time to plan anything beyond the bare basics of 'delivery' makes the whole place seem like its stuck in the 1950s.",No,,"thank you for arranging this. Love, in haste and exhaustion, and solidarity, Sophie xxx",,"The studio based programs, such as sculpture and painting, are hardest hit by this situation. Virtual learning does not begin to address the practical needs of these courses. The College could offer us subsidised access to 3D making facilities in London, ie by subsidising access to London Sculpture Studios, Building Blocks, etc. The problem here is that these places really should be closed as they are not essential businesses, so there is very little recourse the college has. Which leads back to the idea of suspension of the courses.","FORMAT - if the degree show is virtual, we must know and be involved in the format design",,,"I don't know the answer to the above. Genuinely. Because I think the one good thing about this situation is it has made us all realise we HAVE to work collectively, which is not supported by the traditional methods of the physical degree show, and that all good art is actually made by groups, not individuals. The physical degree show is problematic too - a lot of the time it looks like a mini art fair, again a dated and unprogressive way to think about what a degree should be doing and how the format could be used to show this, and one which re-creates a capitalist and individualist approach. 

I want a physical degree show - but now we've had time to talk about, the last thing I want is a 'traditional' RCA physical show, because, to be honest, I think we can do better than that.",

6. security staff repeatedly preventing visitors accompanying students to enter the building in Kensington, even with a departmental email. Now saying they want notification 24hrs in advance.

When it comes to 1st years, I think what the university is offering will be okay in some ways to meet some of my needs while we are stuck in home. While we won’t have facility access to carry out experiments, I think this time inside will allow us to do a lot of research on things we’re interested and may even help us formulate a clear plan of attack when facilities are all ready to go. While I would much rather be cheating in physical, I think creating a research file and really thinking about why we are doing the things we are doing will be just as beneficial (it will not replace physically working within the RCA though). ",No,No,No,Yes,"I think with the circumstances they offer beneficial routes for us as 1st years that can surely aid our work in a more professional way. However, I do believe we are missing out on being able to physically work and that is a huge reason I decided to attend the RCA, because the facilities that are offered are very good. ",,No,No,Yes,Yes,"As a first year, for me personally I can do other work during this time that is still related to my practice without having access to the RCA equipment, however when it does come to materials not having access to a space like the yarn shoppe is going to be a huge strain when I wish to try out different materials, as I will have to buy most likely larger quantities of material than I need to do small samples of work. ",,,,"I am not a second year, but as someone who fell in love with textiles because of the physical quality they have within the hand, I think the university would be making a huge mistake asking people in fields who rely on people being able to actually interact with material to do a virtual degree show. There is a reason Brick and Mortar is still the leading way people consume within the fashion and textiles industry and that has a lot to do with the fact that PHYSICALLY TOUCHING things will never be replaced by a digital image no matter if it’s 2D OR 3D. So with that, I do believe a Physical show is the best option for the second year students, as they have already put a lot of time and effort into their work and especially the way they think it should be displayed in the end and that cannot be easily changed when it’s meant to be taken into a digital format.

 I think the RCA are giving all the options that is possible in such a disruptive moment, however, I'd like to have more information about visa for international students, how to deal with the bills for those who are facing issues for paying their rent and lost their jobs, actions towards well being, online library access and so on.

It seems problematic to force answers from questions that could change dramatically in the days, weeks and months we are all facing. Having said that, that answer would not reflect the space I find myself in as a 1st year student. If I was to postpone my studies now, what would that mean for me as a student and my progression into 2nd year? I think it would be problematic to do so if it means we are are then faced with even more increase of student numbers (with the new set of 1st year students due in September).

What they are currently experiencing is a frustrating and upsetting situation that needs to be handled with compassion and trust. However, I found many of the questions hard to answer as my own situation is largely unknown, and it seems to be changing at quite a rapid pace. With so much unknown, it feels problematic to tie us down as students to one set answer or one set solution to a problem that is multi-faceted and changing on a daily basis. I say this in regards to the study plans that the institution has put in place, but also in response to this questionnaire which is asking me to state my preference in a situation that is likely to change given the personal circumstances that many of us are facing (living and working costs, family arrangements, mental and physical health concerns). I am happy to answer questions now to gauge an overall 'feeling' from the student body, but I want it to be noted that I don't wish to hold myself to any of the options I have selected in this form.

I no longer have the college on a pedestal but that largely stems from the  maturing of my own ideas and values. I think it is a very good institution but one that is sadly leaning towards becoming a business rather than a holistic educational experience. I'm not massively surprised seeing as many HE institutions are going/have gone this way. I didn't come to the RCA because it was simply '#1 best art school' I came here because I knew the teaching and technical support would push me to new levels within my work.

The least we can expect is compensation for all this time, the deadlines need to be  rescheduled accordingly (AT LEAST!)! Additionally, there have been no words about refunds!

Toilets don’t work ( only 4 in the basement in an 8 story building with hundreds of students and staff), the lifts are out of order, the textiles print and dye lab is closed aso. In summary, it is very disappointing and doesn’t meet the standard of other art schools, most definitely not the No 1 and especially in terms of how they treat their students and staff with absolute disgrace and disrespect. Ual, goldsmith and slade for example all responded without respect to the need of their CURRENT students and listened to their worries. NOT THE RCA. Where does ALL our money go if not to facilities, workshops and staff? Who gets rich from our debts? Now they found an even more efficient way of gaining more money for less effort. Online learning and degree show for current students and get them out as quickly as possible so that extremely overpriced summer courses can take place . I‘M EMBARRASSED TO BE GRADUATING FROM THIS SCHOOL I don’t want be associated with such a greedy, undemocratic and careless institution that doesn’t give a fuck about their staff and students. Not to mention that one decides to do an MA with the intention to grow and improve, personally AND PROFESSIONALLY but since the standard of our work will seriously diminish now due to the college’s decisions to not postpone anything and force the students into working from home and graduating asap I’m absolutely frightened by the thought not being able to competed  for jobs in a market that due to the crisis will be even more competitive than it already was.",No,No,I don’t think that whether there is a virtual or physical degree show is the  most pressing question/ worry but to be able to produce work at a standard that meets the standard expected from an MA student or for many students to even be able to produce work at all!! ,,,,,,,

Offering mental support to address the distress caused by the same institution is not a solution. Furthermore, I doubt many students are capable of trusting the College enough to even utilise it.
What the RCA also misunderstood is that the Leave of Absence will not only be taken by students who disagree with the idea of online learning and a digital show, but also by those who are unable to cope with current amounts of stress and uncertainty which have only been exacerbated by the College. Penalising those students with lack of a physical degree show next year is outrageous and shameful.

I also choose the university because the program is two years and I thought out of every program I had looked into, a two year program would give me the better ability to really learn and explore everything I wish to explore.

Within my small design specialism there were about 100 students total(between the four years of study). I have been at a large university and I think RCA has a lot of really great things to offer, but I think the main issue is that the communication between the administration and students is lost in translation. 

The RCA isn’t that big and because of that, I think logistics should be handled better and in a more timely fashion. Communication needs to be better between admission and students as the admission team should really be understanding how everything is running on a more detail oriented level. Elevators shouldn’t be out for a week and a half at a university of this size, dye labs that have to sustain a whole community should be working in tip top shape. The amount of tutors should balance better the amount of students so that we all have a chance to be our best selves. This isn’t to say we as students should be able to roll with punches because I think that is important to be able to adapt and learn how to cope with difficulties, but I think those difficulties shouldn’t hinder us as students from achieving outcomes we wish to achieve. Simple changes could  improve RCA to make the experience that much better and I think that is all students are really asking for. ",Yes,,,,,,,,,

People get tired and upset when they are treated like that. The administrators of university are not responsible for our student’s benefit, that is not deserved to be called world No.1. So does the options for year 1 MA, I can not see any difference from the two options, because I don’t know for us who rely on machines and workshops can find much help from the online resources. I know during this hard time everyone need to understand each other, but again, when we choose to study online, the university should compensate their students, at least refund part of our tuition instead of forcing us to make an unfair choice.","I’m so appreciate this part of the questions. The quality of study is what I care about most. As a textile student, I can’t get access to the machines and workshops, even a real tutorial form our tutors. I    only depend on myself and my poor handmade crochet or other digital work which I would learn by myself later, so what’s the difference between I enter MA or not?

I am unhappy with the decisions that have been made but I am at a point where I would just like to finish my degree as normal, I feel we lack the support of the college and I would rather complete my education than prolonging this process into the indefinite. (Even though working online requires me to shift my practice in the final term, my work was intentionally about exploring physicality and materiality which is something I can't investigate in the same way.)
What would be appreciated from the college now would be some of the options I know the reps have explored, reimbursement of the final term, extended workshop access post graduation (so I can revisit the work I intended to complete in the final term) or a physical degree show post graduation.

In the mean time, vis com students are now in independent study mode, we don't have regular lectures or classes like some of the other pathways - the move to online means we have very little interaction with the university and during our final term it would be nice to have scheduled lectures etc so we feel we can benefit from online learning in some way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My elective/expanded practice had to reach its necessary face-to-face teaching before the Easter holidays. During the strike, I have used printmaking facilities that were necessary for my projects since technicians were not on strike. This is why by the moment RCA was closed, I have almost completed all of the required physical work. Now I am working on the finalization of my projects and dissertation.

Postponing deadlines would make it more complicated for me since I also am trying to apply for exchange in Kyoto that maybe not even an option in case of delay of all assessments.",No,No,No,No,The online route (continuing studies) is satisfactory,"I assume so because, in the current extraordinary situation, I appreciate that there is at least online education that is ongoing.

However,  despite the strike, interruptions, and raised financial issues (also connected to strike), teaching and facilities have proved my expectations. ",,Yes,,"About the last question: despite my comments about postponing assessments for the first years, I think that an online degree show is absolutely unfair and that it should be postponed if students wish so. ","I do not need facilities at the current moment, but this is only due to the fact that printmaking would close in April for a visual communication student anyway (reasonable priority for printmakers), and this is why I have tried to finish my work before Easter. 
It was a lucky accident for me. I might have used other facilities later after the quarantine, but I can not answer this question clearly since I do not know when I will be able to come back to London.

In these unforeseen circumstances, I really appreciate the support from tutors, while still feel it is necessary to consider how much students loose because of not using studio equipment. Especially regarding fees that have been paid. I am not claiming that it was the RCA's responsibility, and instead of compensation for the situation that is out of control, it would be reasonable to have a fee discount for the next year that would compensate lost access to studios/facilities/teaching.","As a first-year, I can not answer the majority of these questions.

I thought I would be receiving a world class education from an institution that values knowledge and skill over profit. ,Yes,"I have been shocked by the steps the RCA has taken to make extra money without even paying the tutors and lecturers living wages. They allowed far more students in before they had adequate enough space and equipment to accommodate them. This led to not enough tech resources which severely impacted our WIP show, it led to the offices of the staff being turned into studio space for incoming students which meant that we had to have all meetings with staff and tutors in the canteen or the cafe next door, and the rooms were never available to book, so many of my tutorials took place in the cafe next door the campus. In addition, I was not aware how much the printmaking facilities would cost. It is prohibitively expensive to screen print at the RCA, which discouraged my practice and the practice of others. The one thing the RCA really has going for it is incredibly dedicated tutors and lecturers who do an amazing job of teaching, but the RCA doesn't pay them enough to live so they had to go on strike, costing us even more time lost on our education. When you value profit over education, you cannot succeed as a university, and you cannot achieve the intended goal of higher education. Instead, you send people out into the workforce under prepared and riddled with debt.
